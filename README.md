## 🧩 Introduction  
This project is a **Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application** built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript (ES6)**.  
Developed as part of my **Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech (Task-03)**, it demonstrates my ability to combine logic, interactivity, and modern UI design into a clean, responsive browser-based game.  

It’s a digital remake of a timeless classic — where **strategy meets simplicity**.

✅ Restart button to reset the game instantly  
✅ Responsive design — works on desktop, tablet, and mobile  
✅ Lightweight — built with no frameworks or dependencies  
✅ Subtle animations and clean UI for smooth gameplay

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes  
Through this project, I strengthened my front-end development foundation by learning:  
- How to manage **game state arrays** and UI synchronization.  
- Designing a modular **JavaScript game logic system**.  
- Implementing **dynamic DOM manipulation** without external libraries.  
- Using **CSS Grid & Flexbox** for responsive layouts.  
- Creating visually appealing **hover, click, and animation effects**.
